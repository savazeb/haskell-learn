# Haskell for Beginners
A repo to learn the basic of haskell programming language. Haskell is a general-purpose, statically-typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation. Haskell is ideal for building very complex concurrent systems. 

This project is inspired from udemy course by [ProgLang-MainSt](https://www.udemy.com/user/proglang-mainst/). Check the course https://www.udemy.com/course/haskell-tutorial/.
